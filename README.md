# Fleet-Management-Dashboard🚚

## 📌 Project Overview

This **advanced Fleet Management Dashboard** analyzes a transportation company’s operational performance from **2018 to 2019**, using **Microsoft Excel** as a full-scale analytical tool. It consolidates:

- Driver performance  
- Shipment activity  
- Fuel & maintenance costs  
- Revenue across U.S. states  

All in an interactive environment powered by **Power Query, Pivot Tables, Slicers**, and **VBA toggle buttons**.

> 🎯 **Goal**: Transform raw spreadsheets into actionable business intelligence.

## 🧭 Dual Dashboard Views

I designed a **dual-dashboard system** that lets users toggle between:

- **👷 Driver Insight View**
- **💰 Revenue Insight View**

These allow stakeholders to **quickly answer key business questions** at both a high level and granular level.

## 📈 Key Business Insights

- 📉 **September 2019 Revenue Drop**  
  - Flagged, but traced to incomplete data (ends in September)  
  - 📌 **Lesson**: Always validate data completeness before making conclusions  

- 📍 **Top Performing States**  
  - California: $33M  
  - Texas: $29M  
  - New York: $24M  
  - → Ideal regions for **expansion and investment**  

- 🚨 **High Maintenance Drivers**  
  - Low mileage + high costs → recommend training or vehicle audits  

- ❤️ **Strong Customer Loyalty**  
  - 98% retention = high upselling potential  
  - → Introduce loyalty rewards or targeted campaigns  

---

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- **Chart Switching Logic**  
  → Used VBA to switch charts (only one chart per placeholder)

- **Imbalanced Data Periods**  
  → Data ends in Sept 2019; made this visually clear to avoid false insights

- **UI Balance**  
  → Designed a bold yet readable interface (testing contrast, fonts, spacing)

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- 📖 Data is nothing without a story  
- 🎛 Interactivity = better decision-making  
- 💡 Excel can rival BI tools when extended with VBA  
- 🔍 Always double-check trends — anomalies may reflect incomplete context  

---

## 📌 Simulated Business Impact

- ⚡ Reduce fuel & maintenance costs by **10–15%**  
- 📈 Increase operational visibility  
- 🕒 Save **30+ hours/month** in manual reporting  
- 💼 Support regional investment and driver training decisions  

---

## 🔮 If I Expanded This Project

- Add **forecasting** using historical data  
- Automate **email reports** with KPI summaries  
- Connect Excel to **Power BI** for real-time fleet performance

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This project shows how **Excel**, when used creatively, becomes more than a spreadsheet tool — it becomes a **decision engine**. Built for operations managers and business analysts, this dashboard enables faster, smarter insights without needing to scroll through endless rows of data.

> ✅ It’s interactive, professional, and designed for real business impact.
